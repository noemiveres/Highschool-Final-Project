# Highschool-Final-Project
This game was made to obtain a certificate in informatics specialization.

The Delivery Game is a game where we put boxes into a car and then we have to transport these packages. 
The tracks become more and more difficult, with more obstacles placed on them. 
It is important not to deviate from the road because, same as for collisions, the level restarts. 
We complete a level when the counter, which shows the distance traveled, exceeds 100. 
If we complete all levels, we win.
